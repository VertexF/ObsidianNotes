# PACER - Conceptual information

This is all about concepts. It's what to do conceptually rather than how do to do something something which is procedural. This information is all about:
- Facts and explanations
- Relationship between facts
- Theories and principles
- The application of theories and principles on a conceptual level.

The hard sciences have a lot of conceptual problems and information in them. So when you're solving problems you need both the Procedural and Conception knowledge to solve it.

To master conceptual knowledge you need to be **mapping** information together into a meaningful mesh. Experts are able to look at problems and connect different ideas together to get the answer then apply the correct procedure. 

So when you are studying conceptual things you need to build those connections an expert has, even if the information is linearly laid.

To do this you can use obsidian connections but it might be more useful to break out a pen and paper and start trying to make connections between the things you've learn. Anything good as long as it's mapping concepts together.

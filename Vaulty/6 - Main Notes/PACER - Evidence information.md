# PACER - Evidence information

Evidence based information support conceptual information and makes the concepts more concrete.

Maybe we have learnt a new concept for shaders the evidence would be seeing how it interacts with other details in our renderer. 

To master this type of information that back up some concepts with examples. You **store and rehearse** it. So with evidence just write it down to store it in obsidian.

Rehearsing always comes later not while your currently studying. How you want to rehearse this type of information is by:
- Thinking about how you would apply and use this information.
- What problem could this solve.
- Teaching the evidence to yourself or others.
- Attempting to solve a problem with this knew info.

The evidence need PAC type of information to be useful so this shouldn't take all your time.

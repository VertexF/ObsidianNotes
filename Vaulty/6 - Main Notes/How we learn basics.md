# How we learn basics
The brain builds neuron's that connect via synapses and that's how the brain learns stuff. You basically have infinite storage. 

You're brain learns things based on how important they are. When you're going about learning you need to tackle the things are you are bad at, that will give you away to automatically select what to learn next.

Sleep is extremely important because it builds your synapses and cleans them from metabolic toxins.

Being social and exercise help the brain make neuron's.

Learning is better when you do it in silence. There are two learning modes diffuse and focus mode. The diffuse is more creative and allows your brain to wonder. Use both, switch when it makes sense.

Things might be hard because it's hard to relate to. Like learning Greek, I don't know anything about that so learning random Greek language fact will be hard to remember.

It's a good idea to try and relate things you learnt to other ideas you already know so you can learn about them this helps the idea stick because it's connect to other stuff.

Learning can be painful but once you get going things stop being painful. It's all part of the process outcome independence baby.

# The two reading stages

There are two types of stages when it comes to studying two stages consumption and digestion. Consumption is about what you read/listen/watch, digestion is what you do with that information to help remember it.

These need to be balanced it's so important that you do this or you start forget what you've learnt if you over consume. It's like you start to vomit out the information.

The digestion is the part of the learning part of the process that starts to reinforce what's actually important to apply the knowledge to the real work.

We digest the stuff we've consumed and keep things balance so we can start applying it to the real world.

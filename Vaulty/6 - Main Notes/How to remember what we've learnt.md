# How to remember what we've learnt

This is concerned with boosting our retention of information we've consumed so we can apply it when we need. 

To avoid forgetting we have to be okay with stopping and going slower. The reason being is there is a hard limit on how much new information we can take in at once. 

So with using a good system we can improve our retention which means we don't have relearn things as much and using a good system will take you to expert level. 

This will be about he PACER system and why it's a good idea, but it's important you keep this concept in mind while reading about it.

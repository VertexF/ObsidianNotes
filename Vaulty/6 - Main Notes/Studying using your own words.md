# Studying using your own words

When studying or learning you need to use your own words to describe what you've learnt. The reason you need to do this is that this is were the learning actually happens or at least more of it. 

You know from your own experience you have to spend hours and hours reading, listening or watching things to understand what you've learnt, or you start forgetting things as time goes on, even if it's considered basic. This is because just watching [Arseny Kapoulkine](https://www.youtube.com/@zeuxcg) write his niagara renderer isn't helping you as much as it could.

The struggle is the point. Learning will take longer in the moment but it will be with it in the long run. Trust the process, this is how you're gonna get good.

# PACER - Reference information

This type of information is one of pieces of information that only help with the details of something. This type of information is small and tied to a conceptual information but doesn't change the concept.

A value of a mathematical concept would be a reference type of information. 

Just like with evidence style information to master this type of information you **store and rehearse**. This is were Anki comes in, if you need to be able recall a piece of information to help with the details of a concept then Anki is were you should store and rehearse. That being said you can just store in your notes and look it up when you need it.  

Just **DON'T** spend all your time trying to mesmerise when you see it. Spot it, store and worry about recall later. The PAC part of PACER is more important than the ER.

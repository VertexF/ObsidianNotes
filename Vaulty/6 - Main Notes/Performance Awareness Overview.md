# Performance Awareness Overview

The general idea of being performance aware is to be able to write code that isn't slow rather than learn to write a lot of very specialised code to make something fast.

You should be interested in two things if while coding to be performance aware. 
1) **Speed** of the instructions on the CPU. Not all instructions are equal. So if there is away to write instructions to run faster either by using different ones or doing things else we are golden.
2) **Reduce** the number of instructions.

As CPU's got more complicated which started in the 90's programmers stop learning what instructions actually run on the CPU. 

Being a performance aware programmer means that you do roughly know what's going on a CPU, so you can make better decisions and know when something is slow, because you know how the underlying instructions should be working.

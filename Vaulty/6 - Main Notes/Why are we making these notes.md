# Why are we making these notes

The whole point of write these atomic notes is so that you can distil the ideas you learnt from the source material and remix them isolate from the original source material and extra the major points from the material. 

The will allow you to do 2 things: 
1) Now you can read this outside of the context of the source material so you don't need to re-read material you've already read. This will save time when you are looking something up, you don't need to go back to the source material and waste time. 
2) This is how you start to come up with your own ideas and connect ideas to older ideas you've already learnt making things easier to remember.

Consider how this will work for Vulkan if you've learnt how to create an instances and you then a physical device, you connect these ideas together and you have a chain of simple notes to follow to remind yourself. Not only that you should have explained in your own words meaning that it will be unique to you making unique code and better code. Sounds exciting to be honest.

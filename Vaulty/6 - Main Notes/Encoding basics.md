# Encoding basics

You'll need to make sure that you're constantly encoding new information (aka taking it in) in little pieces rather than just consuming information.

You do this with some of the things from the parser system namly [[PACER - Analogous information]] is an encoding method.

This is a habit that isn't natural to start with, eventually though it will become that way if you give it enough time. Remember that learning is a struggle and shouldn't be easy because when it is, you've stopped learning.

You really need to use your brain and think about what you've learnt.

Encoding is all about simplifying, connecting, comparing and group everything. So if you've learnt something new in vulkan, you'll want to simply it down as much as possible without losing accuracy. Then connect it to other ideas, while comparing how it's different and similar to other concepts. Finally, group the ideas.

What I'm weak with is simplifying, you shouldn't just try to remember everything you've read/heard. It should be a process of continuous refinement to get at the core ideas.

Anything your write down and study shouldn't be concrete, it needs to be something that can be changed over time with more and better information. It's also true that you'll learn stuff wrong so you're going to have to be aware of this and be willing to make changes.

Again it's important to note that revision should go through the same process. Learning doesn't stop once you've learn something for the first time no matter how well you learnt it.

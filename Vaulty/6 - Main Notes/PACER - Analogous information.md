# PACER - Analogous information

The definition of this means something similar or comparable to something in general. So like steely is a analogous to a marble.

This type of information is anything that can be connected to other piece of knowledge you already know. For example, moving memory from RAM to disk is like moving memories from short term memory to long term memory. 

Analogues information is about connecting two ideas, this can happen with literally any piece of knowledge you already know. You need to be looking for were analogies can be formed when studying. 

When you find analogous information you need to **critique** it. Make sure it's good. You can do this by thinking about these things when you see or make an analogy:
- How are these connected to each other.
- How are these ideas different from each other.
- In what situation does this analogy **NOT** work.
	- If this analogy doesn't work can you find a better one, change or adept the analogy so it does work?

Analogous is special as both [[PACER - Procedural information]]  and [[PACER - Conceptual information]] both contain analogues within them so you also need to be critique new information there too.

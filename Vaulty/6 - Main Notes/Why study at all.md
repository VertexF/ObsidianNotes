# Why study at all

The return on investment of learning how to study/learn is delayed is so you can't expect things to work right away. Learning something new actually activates part of the brain that deals with pain, so if you're feeling bad you're actually learning.

This is designed to be a long term process. So this is designed to take from a journeyman programmer/game developer to an expert level one as for long time you haven't studied at all.

Remember how you felt on todays 19/09/2025 in the middle of a game jam. Come back this when you feeling it's not worth continuing.

Keep main notes less than 500 words. Remember slowing down is a good thing for learning so it's okay if things take longer to get through because you're writing things up in the Source Material notes. You're gonna save time in the long run when you're more skill and have remembered more stuff.

Keep code snippets less than 20 lines of code. If you need to test something or mess around with something please use Visual Studio or whatever. At the very least break things up into small code snippets.

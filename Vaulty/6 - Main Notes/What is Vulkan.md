# What is Vulkan

Vulkan is more than just a graphics API. It a low level API that exposes the programmers to all the rich features of a modern GPU including mobile. As it's created around modern hardware, it support all the modern features graphics API like OpenGL struggles to.

As it's new it easily support compute and graphics as separately as it's unified under one system. Meaning you can running graphics and computer in parallel is much easier now.

Vulkan also support multithreading much easier now as it's more up to date with modern hardware and doesn't do just global context switch between states.

It's verbose and a difficult API to learn. With all the power come a lot more things to code yourself and on top of that it's platform agnostic which compounds the issue.

# PACER - Procedural information

This information category is to do with HOW to do something. So if you read or watch something and your shown how to do something. For example, your shown how to calculate the determinate of a matrix. This is a procedural piece of information.

How to get this type of information to stick is as **SOON** as you see that procedure, you need to practice. Learning procedural information is all about **PRACTICE**. No note taking, just practice.

If you come across procedural information and you can't practice. Do either of the two following things:
- Move on to something else.
- Stop

If you don't stop or move on you'll begin to overwrite that piece of information and you'll need to learn it again anyway. So take this seriously. You need to practice procedures.

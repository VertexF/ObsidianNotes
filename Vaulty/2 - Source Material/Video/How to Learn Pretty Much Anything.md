Chapter 2 - How to remember stuff
The brain builds neuron's that connect via synapses and that's how the brain learns stuff. You basically have infinite storage. 
You really need to sleep well, because you can't cram all the info in your brain all at once. Learning is repetition, you need to strengthen these connections.
You're brain learns things based on how important they are. When you're going about learning you need to tackle the things are you are bad at, that will give you away to automatically select what to learn next. Like studying and learning for you right now. Sleep is extremely important because it builds your synapses and cleans them from metabolic toxins, this stops things getting muddled. Being social and physical active helps make more neuron's and doing the opposite makes the opposite happen.
Chapter 3 - You still have to do everything yourself.
Learning is better when you do it in silence. There are two learning modes diffuse and focus mode. The diffuse is more creative and allows your brain to wonder.
A large part of learning is problem is problem solving.
Chapter 4 - It's hard bro.
Things might be hard because it's hard to relate to. Like learning greek, I don't know anything about that so learning random greek language fact because it's isolated.
It's a good idea to try and relate things you learnt to other ideas you already know so you can learn about them this helps the idea stick because it's connect to other stuff.
Chapter 5 - You have to test yourself
Testing yourself can come in many different ways but you need feedback on what you did right or wrong. Making mistakes is great, this is part of the learning process, it's actually good.
Chapter 6 - Everything about the process
If you expect the pain of learning something new to be bad you assume that everything after that point will be too, this is not the case. Finding ways to help get the ball rolling is a great way keep yourself motivated. Outcome independence baby.

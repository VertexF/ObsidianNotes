#### What are we trying to achieve here.
This also include, everything including studying and general learning.

This way of learning should be harder than just passively consuming things, but there is a hard limit on how much new information your brain can take in at a given time. If you stick with a good system you'll actually keep improving beyond the journeyman level in graphic/vulkan programming, whereas most people stop like you did.
#### Reading Stages
There are two stages to reading, the consumption period and the digestion period.

There is an assumption made that just reading a tonne that you'll be able to remember more because you've read so much, this is false. The last thing you want to be doing is consuming content as triple speed or reading things as fast as possible or just consuming tonne of content. This isn't how learning works at all.

The important part of learning how much data you consume, it's more important to when it comes to learning it's the data that stick around after consuming things. That's how you learn. This is actually the second part of the learning process the digestion phase of learning.

You can't be perfect, you can't remember literally everything you read, and you shouldn't want to either. There was a man who could remember everything he read, called Kim Peek (they based the film Rain Man on him). He could remember literally everything from books he read with such perfect recall he could transcribe the book perfectly, including all the grammar. He could literally remember everything. He had a problem called FG syndrome, that's how he was able to remember literally everything he read. 

We don't want this for our learning, because it is not enough to simply remember everything. This is because we need to apply and use reasoning on the knowledge we have remembered. What we need to do is just remember what we need to to apply it to the real world.
#### PACER System
This is basically the idea that not all information is equal. This should help you manage the information your trying to learn so you can use the useful stuff. This should in theory help with making things easier to remember, require less time and more effective. 

With reading and studying in general if you don't have a plan of attack you can get to the bottom of a page or end of a video and completely forget what you consumed, because you started passively consuming the information.

First we want to find out what category the information falls into using this PACER system, then we can digest what we've read leading to deep understanding. This should help use encode short term memory into long term memory.

What you're aiming with consuming and digesting balancing it out. You want don't want to be purely memories or purely just practicing, you'll start to get stuff if you do that or struggle needlessly.

So when you've consumed something you need to digest it for it to be useful to you.

If you continue to try to consume the more information instead of practice, this is the equivalent  over eating. You're just gonna over do it and "vomit" all the information out aka forget what you've read. This should be taken seriously because on average people forget **90%** of what they've read after they've read it, which is NUTS. 

What we are doing with PACER system is actually trying to increase the retention of information rather than just consuming more.
#### Procedural
This is the P in PACER and it tells you HOW something should be done. Like this video, your studying right now. The guy is telling you how to remember stuff. This is all about the technique of a task. 

To be able to target and master this type of information is simply with practice. If you see procedural information on how to do something you should be practicing it as **SOON** as possible. Remember this about being efficiency so practicing a procedure you've learn as soon as you can will help you remember things in the long run. It will save time over all, even if it's a pain in the ass right now. Practicing this type of procedural stuff just stop you forgetting things.

There is a problem, what if you're reading a thing and you can't practice it right away or you don't have time? There are two ways to solve this:
- You move on to something else
- You simply stop studying and wait until you can practice that task.
**Don't** just try to memories how to do it, it will waste time in the long run.
#### Analogous 
The definition of this means something similar or comparable to something in general. So like steely is a analogous to a marble. 

This information is actually easier to remember, because this information is information that can be related to other thing you already know. For example, lets say you learning about CPU caching for the first time you might analogous to how you've cached graphics pipelines in Vulkan which are about caching files for later use and not really about making sure your using the L1 cache on a CPU.

When you connect two ideas that similar you end up creating an analogy. An analogy can form with literally anything you already know. This can be within a topic itself.

So when we are studying, we need to be actively thinking if the ideas we are consuming have already been connected to another piece of knowledge so we create analogy. 

So when we find analogous information we want to critique it. So how this works is you first create the analogy and then critique how good that analogy is, really think about it. So 3 good steps to critique the analogy would be:
- How are these things connected to each other.
- How do these ideas differ from each other.
- In what situation does this analogy **NOT** make sense.
	- If the analogy doesn't make that much sense, is there away to extend and change it so it works better.
Remember the goal here is to improve retention so it's important to slow down and do this to avoid forgetting. Has been scientifically to help with retention.

As you already guess, analogous information can exist in the procedural information. Like if you're learning a new piece of geometry algebra, it might be analogous to something you already know and it might be just a straight procedure. This is always true for conceptual knowledge too, analogous information connects to both.
##### Conceptual
This information is concerned with what to do, rather than how to do something. If you're in a field like science this is mostly conceptual information. So this contains things like facts, relationships between facts and explanation, theories and principles and how to apply all this in a conceptual way. 

When you're solving a problem you need both the conceptual and procedural knowledge to get through it.

When we find that the information is conceptual we need to using mapping. Mapping is what we are doing with obsidian we are connecting the knowledge and mapping it together strengthening the connection of all the other concepts we've learnt about. This is because conceptual knowledge fits in a network, it's all non-linear.

Experts are able to look at problems and start at any point in the conceptual mapping and move from one node to another. All allowing advanced problems to be solved.

The reason mapping works so well is because it gives you the bigger picture of what's going on when the connections are made. 

The mapping doesn't have to be done just with obsidian mapping concepts can happen with pen and paper, old school mind map thing. 

Again analogous information might exist here so make those connections too.
#### Evidence
Evidence support conceptual information and makes things more concrete. Examples are a type of evidence that can prove a conceptual point. 

Maybe we have learnt a new concept for shaders the evidence would be seeing how it interacts with other details in our renderer. 

To master this type of information we need to store and rehearse it. Store just means we collect that piece of evidence and write it down somewhere. So as soon as we find some evidence about a data, time, or something anything, you should be storing in obsidian or something. 

Rehearse come a little later, this is key for retention. So we rehearse this evidence information by thinking about to we would apply and use this piece of evidence and what concept does this evidence does this link back to. This can be done with solving a problem, teaching other people, explaining it to yourself or answering someone questions. Anything that applies the information is rehearsing.

The evidence need PAC type of information to be useful so this shouldn't take all your time.
#### Reference
This is lower level and is just concerned with the details of the information that doesn't change the concept. This might be the exact value of a maths constant, knowing this doesn't change the concept of a matrix transform for example.

To handle this you store and rehearse just like evidence.

The reference type of information is difficult to apply to anything like a problem. So to remember, you've just gotta recall it when you need it. Using something like Anki here is perfect because you've just gotta be able to recall it when needed.

Like with evidence type information, **DON'T** waste your time trying to memories reference style information on the stop. Just store and and test yourself on it later. PAC is again more important.

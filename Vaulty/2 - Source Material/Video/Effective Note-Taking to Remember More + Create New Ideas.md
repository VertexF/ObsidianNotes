### Source Notes
This allows you to understand books better and it allows you to create new ideas from the stuff you read. The first half is making these source notes, you have to do this in your own words for some reason. I think it helps you remember things better.

Writing stuff in your own words makes you reorder in the information you just took in making you learn it better. Remember effort is how the learning process happens.

Next thing you have to do is check what you've written and see if it make sense to you. It allows you digest the information and make it your own and explain easily back to yourself and other people. If you can't rewrite it, you likely don't understand what you've consumed. If you're not writing things in your own words you likely need to go back and over what you've read/watched or whatever.

The whole point of this system which includes writing things in your own words is so you can remember what you've consumed. Like with Vulkan, it requires a lot of knowledge and concepts to do anything useful so if you slow down and word things yourself and actually take your time, you're gonna remember literally all the things you've been forgetting. Meaning that you will start to become an expert. The reason this works is that the learning process is helped with struggling, you've already wrote about this in a note, but it's important to remember this because you are impatient. Remember that taking your time WILL save you time in the long run.
#### Atomic Notes
We call these atomic because the information doesn't have any context, just the raw point. The source notes help you extract the information/data you wanted to get from the source material. However atomic notes stand on there and can stand on their own to explain the point. So if you come back years from now and re-read your atomic notes, you don't need to know where the information came from, you can just understand the concept. This has the extra idea of this is that you start to come up with ideas yourself, meaning you'll be able to start coming with your own coding ideas in your projects outside of just copying someone else's idea.

Most of the features in Vulkan 1.2 going from 1.1 are optional. You'll need to there not always available this depends on the graphics driver.

Vulkan 1.2 really tried to get the shaders closer to be able to run C-like code on the GPU. The shader languages have always been C-like but have been heavily restricted on what types you could use and things like that. 

Historically floats were the only types you could use in shader code. DX10 int came out and that's it honestly.

I don't understand memory well enough yet!
